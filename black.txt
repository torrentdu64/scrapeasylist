[Verse 1]

E               A     Asus4 A
Sheets of empty canvas
          E                   A Asus4 A
untouched sheets of clay
E                 A
They spread out before me
       E
as her body once did
E           A     Asus4 A
All five horizons,
          E             A                     Asus4 A
revolved around her soul (as the earth to the sun)
E             A
Now the air I tasted and breathed,
    E
has taken a turn
     C                                   Em
Oooh all I know I taught her was... everything
     C                               Em
Oooh all I know she gave all... that she wore


[Hook]

       D
And my bitter hands
        C
Shake beneath the clouds
                 Em
Of what was everything
        D                      C
All the pictures have all been washed in black
             Em
Tatooed everything.


[Verse 2]

  E      A           Asus4 A
I take a walk outside
       E               A            Asus4 A
I'm surrounded by some kids at play
E                A
I can feel their laughter
   E
So what can I say
    C                                          Em
Ooh all my twisted thoughts they spin round my head (I'm spinnin')
         C                              Em
Oooh I'm spinning how quick the sun can drop awayayayayay


[Hook]

       D
And my bitter hands
   C
  on broken glass
                 Em
of what was everything
       D                      C
All my pictures have all been washed in black
Em
Tatooed everything


[Verse 3]

       D
All my love gone bad
          C
turned my world to black
            D
tatooed all I see
         C
All that I am
              Em
All that I'll beeeeee    yeaahheah

  D
I know some day you'll have a beautiful life
  C
I know you'll be a sun,
   Em                  D              C
In somebody elses sky, whyhy, whyhy   whyhy
                            Em
can't it be, can't it be in mine.
